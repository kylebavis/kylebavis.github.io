      <description>Getting a robot vacuum a few years ago was a game-changer for me. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite as big of a change as, say, getting a dishwasher would be, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to understate how nice it is to not have to worry about day-to-day &amp;ldquo;maintenance&amp;rdquo; vacuuming.
I&amp;rsquo;d been fairly satisfied with the Ecovacs Deebot for a few years. I think it was a Wirecutter top pick at one point. That said, it really only seemed to work well for cleaning single rooms in one go.</description>

It makes me sad that the original site is offline, but someone uploaded it to YouTube for posterity:</description>
